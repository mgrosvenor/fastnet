\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Baseline}
Discuss the current performance speeds with packet layouts how they are. 

\subsection{Memory speed}

Show how zero copy and memory allocation (eg DCA) affect the overall performance. 

\subsection{Network Byte Ordering}

Show how network byte ordering affects the speed. 

\subsection{Packet layouts}

Show how network byte ordering affects the speed. 

\subsection{Core Scaling}

Show how this scales as we increase core counts.
